# frozen_string_literal: true

#
# A class to describe record layouts for InnoDB indexes. Designed to be usable
# in two different ways: statically built and dynamically built. Note that in
# both cases, the order that statements are encountered is critical. Columns
# must be added to the key and row structures in the correct order.
#
# STATIC USAGE
#
# Static building is useful for building a custom describer for any index
# and looks like the following:
#
# To describe the SQL syntax:
#
#   CREATE TABLE my_table (
#     id BIGINT NOT NULL,
#     name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
#     age INT UNSIGNED,
#     PRIMARY KEY (id)
#   );
#
# The clustered key would require a class like:
#
#   class MyTableClusteredDescriber < Innodb::RecordDescriber
#     type :clustered
#     key "id", :BIGINT, :UNSIGNED, :NOT_NULL
#     row "name", "VARCHAR(100)", :NOT_NULL
#     row "age", :INT, :UNSIGNED
#   end
#
# It can then be instantiated as usual:
#
#   my_table_clustered = MyTableClusteredDescriber.new
#
# All statically-defined type, key, and row information will be copied into
# the instance when it is initialized. Once initialized, the instance can
# be additionally used dynamically, as per below. (A dynamic class is just
# the same as a static class that is empty.)
#
# Note that since InnoDB works in terms of *indexes* individually, a new class
# must be created for each index.
#
# DYNAMIC USAGE
#
# If a record describer needs to be built based on runtime information, such
# as index descriptions from a live data dictionary, instances can be built
# dynamically. For the same table above, this would require:
#
#   my_table_clustered = Innodb::RecordDescriber.new
#   my_table_clustered.type = :clustered
#   my_table_clustered.key "id", :BIGINT, :UNSIGNED, :NOT_NULL
#   my_table_clustered.row "name", "VARCHAR(100)", :NOT_NULL
#   my_table_clustered.row "age", :INT, :UNSIGNED
#
